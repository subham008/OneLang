OneLang is a programming language that aims to be the one language to conquer all  application , no need to learn diffrent languages , one language for every thing 

how we planned to achieve
   .indentation based language(Python like syntax)
   .memory safe (compiler time memory management system)
   .can be interpret , compiled
   .large set of  available compiled target as we use LLVM (e.g x86,x86_64,arm , aarch,thump,risc,wasm and many more that you may never heard of)
   .own build tool and package library inpired bt rust
   .modern features
   .some rules and regulation to make code readable as freeadom of doing anything will create chaos


go to OneLangSamples folder and check the sample codes , to get better context and if you  think you want to contribute , dont hesitate just copy repo on you system and  start making changes
